            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <!-- Unordered list of ingredients -->
            <ul>
                <li>2 ½ pounds russet potatoes, peeled</li>
                <li>1 cup all-purpose flour </li>
                <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt </li>
                <li>1 teaspoon onion salt </li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
                <li>½ cup water, or as needed</li>
                <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying</li>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <!-- Ordered list of steps -->
            <ol>
                <li>Slice potatoes into French fries, and place into cold water so they 
                    won't turn brown while you prepare the oil.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. While the oil is heating, 
                    sift the flour, garlic salt, onion salt, (regular) salt, and paprika into a large bowl. 
                    Gradually stir in enough water so that the mixture can be drizzled from a spoon.</li>
                <li>Dip potato slices into the batter one at a time, and place in the hot oil so they are not 
                    touching at first. The fries must be placed into the skillet one at a time, or they will 
                    clump together. Fry until golden brown and crispy. Remove and drain on paper towels.</li>
            </ol>
