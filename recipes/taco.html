        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <!-- Unordered list of ingredients -->
        <ul>
            <li>10 (7 inch) flour tortillas</li>
            <li>butter-flavored cooking spray</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups cooked, shredded chicken</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups whole kernel corn, drained</li>

            <li>¾ cup shredded Mexican cheese blend</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <!-- Ordered list of steps -->
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Spray both sides of the tortillas with butter-flavored 
                cooking spray. Cut small circles into the tortillas using 
                a 2 3/4-inch round cookie or biscuit cutter. You should be 
                able to get about 3 to 4 circles from each tortilla.</li>
            <li>Flip two 12-cup muffin tins upside down. Fold tortilla circles 
                into a taco shape and arrange each into the space between 2 cups 
                so they hold their shape. Each muffin tin will hold 17 mini tacos.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tacos are just starting to turn golden 
                brown and crispy, checking every few minutes to make sure they don't burn, 
                5 to 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix together chicken, corn, and salsa in a skillet and set over medium-high heat. 
                Cook, stirring occasionally, until heated through, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle cheese blend into the bottom of each taco shell, and fill with the 
                chicken and corn mixture. Top with a dollop of sour cream.</li>
        </ol>
